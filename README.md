# Feathers Inspector

An experimental entity and world inspector for Bevy.

While you might be able to use this project, it is intended to test ideas intended for upstreaming:
see [bevy#15636](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/issues/15636).

If you would like a functional, productive dev tool before then,
you should probably use [`bevy-inspector-egui`](https://github.com/jakobhellermann/bevy-inspector-egui).
