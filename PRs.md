# PR Strategy

## Cleanup

- [] `ShortName` should be orderable to allow for easy sorting
- [] Rename `SystemIdMarker` to something more inspector-friendly
- [] Split apart `Name` (sensu animation and scenes) from `InspectorName` (X-Controversial)
- [] Move camera-attached rendering components (e.g. `Skybox`) to distinct entities for reuse and inspector clarity
