# PR Strategy

## Cleanup

- [] `ShortName` should be orderable to allow for easy sorting
- [] Rename `SystemIdMarker` to something more inspector-friendly

## Foundations

- [] Split apart `Name` (sensu animation and scenes) from `InspectorName` (X-Controversial)
- [] Allow users to register dynamically typed resources and components

## Log-style inspection

- [] Implement `Display` for `TypeInfo` and contained types
- [] Entity name resolution strategy
